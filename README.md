# DENVUE Dashboard  
**Dengue Visualization & Environmental Risk Analytics**

DENVUE is an interactive web dashboard designed to support **barangay-level dengue surveillance and risk assessment** in **Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines**. It transforms epidemiological and environmental data into **clear, actionable insights** for researchers, students, and local decision-makers.

This dashboard serves as the visualization and analytics layer of the **DENVUE Capstone Project**, developed by BS Data Science students of the **University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP)**.

## Project Overview

Dengue remains a persistent public health challenge, particularly in tropical urban environments. While traditional surveillance systems rely on static reports, **DENVUE bridges the gap between raw data and operational insights** by providing:

- Barangay-level dengue analytics**
- Interactive spatial risk mapping**
- Environmental factor integration**
- Machine learning–driven risk interpretation**

The dashboard is designed to be **intuitive, responsive, and data-driven**, allowing users to explore dengue trends over space and time with minimal technical overhead.

## Key Features

- Interactive Map Visualization  
  View dengue risk distribution across barangays using spatial overlays and dynamic legends.

- Data Analytics Panels
  Explore dengue case patterns, incidence trends, and environmental correlations.

- Environmental Context 
  Integrated climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity to support risk interpretation.

- Machine Learning Outputs 
  Displays outputs from regression and classification models used in the study for dengue risk assessment.

- Modular Dashboard Design 
  Built for extensibility — new data sources, models, or visual layers can be added with ease.

## Data Sources

The dashboard visualizes processed outputs derived from:

- Dengue case records (Barangay-level, 2018–present)
- Environmental and climate variables
- Population and spatial boundary datasets
- Machine learning model predictions and risk classifications

>  **Note:** All data used in this dashboard are for **academic and research purposes only**.
