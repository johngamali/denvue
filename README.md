DENVUE: A MACHINE LEARNING-BASED DENGUE CASE ESTIMATION AND DECISION-SUPPORT FRAMEWORK FOR CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL

# 🦟 DENVUE Dashboard  
**Dengue Visualization & Environmental Risk Analytics**

DENVUE is an interactive web dashboard designed to support **barangay-level dengue surveillance and risk assessment** in **Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines**. It transforms epidemiological and environmental data into **clear, actionable insights** for researchers, students, and local decision-makers.

This dashboard serves as the visualization and analytics layer of the **DENVUE Capstone Project**, developed by BS Data Science students of the **University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP)**.

## 🌍 Project Overview

Dengue remains a persistent public health challenge, particularly in tropical urban environments. While traditional surveillance systems rely on static reports, **DENVUE bridges the gap between raw data and operational insights** by providing:

- 📊 **Barangay-level dengue analytics**
- 🗺️ **Interactive spatial risk mapping**
- 🌦️ **Environmental factor integration**
- 📈 **Machine learning–driven risk interpretation**

The dashboard is designed to be **intuitive, responsive, and data-driven**, allowing users to explore dengue trends over space and time with minimal technical overhead.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📍 Interactive Map Visualization**  
  View dengue risk distribution across barangays using spatial overlays and dynamic legends.

- **📈 Data Analytics Panels**  
  Explore dengue case patterns, incidence trends, and environmental correlations.

- **🌡️ Environmental Context**  
  Integrated climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity to support risk interpretation.

- **🧠 Machine Learning Outputs**  
  Displays outputs from regression and classification models used in the study for dengue risk assessment.

- **🧩 Modular Dashboard Design**  
  Built for extensibility — new data sources, models, or visual layers can be added with ease.
